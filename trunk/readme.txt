Easily enables the display of JanesGuide.com awards on your WordPress-generated pages.

== Description ==

Provides two template tags (theme functions), `wp_janesguide_award()` and `wp_janesguide_icon()`, which will display an image of one of two awards in the case of the former or a generic JanesGuide.com linkback icon in the case of the latter.

Use `wp_janesguide_award()` if your site has received a "quality" (default) or a "quality and original" review from JanesGuide.com. For instance, to display a "quality and original" award icon, use code like this:

    <?php wp_janesguide_award('originalquality');?>

To display the 'quality' icon, use:

    <?php wp_janesguide_award();?>

These template tags will produce a linked image. You can customize the destination of the link by going to the JanesGuide Settings page in your WordPress Admin screens.

If you have not received a JanesGuide review yet, use:

    <?php wp_janesguide_icon();?>

== Installation ==

1. Upload `wp-janesguide.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Place `<?php wp_janesguides_award();?>` in your template whereever you would like to display your JanesGuide.com award
