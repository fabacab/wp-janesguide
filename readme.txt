Easily enables the display of JanesGuide.com review awards on your WordPress-generated pages via a widget or template tags.

== Description ==

Provides a simple-to-use widget and, if you want to use them, two template tags (theme functions): `wp_janesguide_award()` and `wp_janesguide_icon()`. These functions display an image of one of two awards in the case of the former or a generic JanesGuide.com linkback icon in the case of the latter. The widget can display any of these three options.

Use `wp_janesguide_award()` if your site has received a "quality" (default) or a "quality and original" review from JanesGuide.com. For instance, to display a "quality and original" award icon, use code like this:

    <?php wp_janesguide_award('originalquality');?>

Another version of the "quality and original" award icon can be used like this:

    <?php wp_janesguide_award('originalquality2');?>

To display the 'quality' icon, use:

    <?php wp_janesguide_award();?>

These template tags will produce a linked image. You can customize the destination of the link by going to the JanesGuide Settings page in your WordPress Admin screens.

If you have not received a JanesGuide review yet, use:

    <?php wp_janesguide_icon();?>

== Installation ==

1. Upload `wp-janesguide.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Add the widget to one of your sidebars, or place `<?php wp_janesguide_award();?>` in your template where you would like to display your JanesGuide.com award
